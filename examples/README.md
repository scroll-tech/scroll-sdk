# Scroll SDK Helper Scripts

This directory contains helper files examples and scripts for managing and interacting with your Scroll SDK deployment.

For additional, more robust helper scripts, checkout the [scroll-sdk-cli](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-sdk-cli).

## Example Files
1. `Makefile.example`: A basic makefile for quickly installing and deleting the charts necessary for the Scroll SDK.
2. `config.toml.example`: A template config.toml file for new deployments. A good starting point for filling out chain-specific details or using the Scroll SDK CLI tool.

## Scripts

1. `l2-generate-txs.sh`: Generates transactions on the L2 network to produce more blocks.
2. `l1-generate-txs.sh`: Generates transactions on the L1 network to produce more blocks.
3. `clear-stuck-txs.sh`: Replaces transactions stuck in the mempool, useful when CCC gets overloaded.
4. `anvil-fund-accounts.sh`: Funds default L1 accounts when using an Anvil devnet.

## Dependencies

These scripts require the following dependencies:

1. [**yq**](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/): A lightweight command-line YAML processor.
   ```
   brew install yq
   ```

2. [**Foundry**](https://book.getfoundry.sh/): A toolkit for Ethereum application development.
   ```
   brew install foundry
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have installed the required dependencies.
2. Make sure the scripts are executable:
   ```
   chmod +x examples/*.sh
   ```
3. Run a script from the repo root directory, for example:
   ```
   ./examples/l2-generate-txs.sh
   ```

Note: These scripts must be run from the root directory of the repository to ensure proper path resolution for the configuration file.

## Configuration

These scripts read configuration values from the `charts/scroll-sdk/config.toml` file. Ensure this file is present and properly configured before running the scripts.

## Notes

- The `clear-stuck-txs.sh` script may need manual nonce setting in some cases.
- Always review and understand a script before running it, especially when it involves sending transactions or modifying account balances.
